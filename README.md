# discord-minecraft-whitelist

A simple plugin for allowing users to whitelist themselves on a Minecraft server.

Functionality to be added:

+ Whitelist a user when they type a command in a specific channel
+ Check that users have a specific role before whitelisting
+ Perform daily checks to confirm users still have the same role / are in the Discord server and remove any that don't (with a configurable grace period)
+ Force users to enter only a single username - don't allow changes without moderator action - to ensure server whitelist stays private.

## How to set up
